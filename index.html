            Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find all of my work and skills. Alot of the work you will see will have a large variety between them. The reasoning behind that is because I thoroughly enjoy learning new things and experimenting with my ideas by creating projects. My skils aren't much at the moment, but I am always learning more and imporving my skill set.
